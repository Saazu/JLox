## JLox

This is a JLox, a simple C-like programming language built usng Java. I am building this to explore concepts in Compilers and Programming Languages

This follows a programming language tutorial from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Bob Nystrom.

I will extend the language beyond the capabilities as described in the book. The language, which I am calling JLox will have the follwoing features:

- Dynamic typing
- Automatic Garbage collection
- First class functions and closures
- Classes
- Tiny standard library


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
